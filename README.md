# Python Coding Challenges

This repository contains Python solutions for a set of coding challenges. The challenges cover various topics, including time conversion, working with integers, and string manipulation.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

Write a function that converts a 12-hour time to a 24-hour time format. The function takes an hour (in the range of 1 to 12), a minute (in the range of 0 to 59), and a period ("am" or "pm") as input and returns a four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.

### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive

Write a function that takes three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments and returns `True` if exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and `False` otherwise.



### Challenge 3: Consonant value

Given a lowercase string with alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou." Assign values to consonants, where a = 1, b = 2, ..., z = 26.
